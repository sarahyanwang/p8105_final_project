## Broadway Opening and Closing Dates (2018-2019 season)

IBDB is an internet database containing a vast collection of information about Broadway shows, theaters, and seasons. We will first investigate the 2018-2019 season, as this season was the most recent season before the COVID-19 pandemic (which massively affected Broadway)

Let's scrape some data (from https://www.ibdb.com/season/1288). First, we will scrape the opening dates:

```{r}
url = "https://www.ibdb.com/season/1288"
broadway_html = read_html(url)

show_names <-
  broadway_html %>%
  html_elements(".s12:nth-child(2) .s6") %>%
  html_text()
```
