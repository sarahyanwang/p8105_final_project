### Introduction
One of our group members' had the unfortunate experience of getting her car towed last year, due to parking near by a fire hydrant in Minnesota. A news report published by New York Post about locations drivers were most likely to get a parking ticket in NYC between October 2020 and September 2021 [-Link]( https://nypost.com/2021/11/18/these-are-the-worst-nyc-streets-for-getting-a-parking-ticket/). We were intrigued by the potential of investigating the parking violation in NYC in 2021.
