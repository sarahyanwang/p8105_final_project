### Introduction

One of our group members' had the unfortunate experience of getting her car towed last year due to parking near a fire hydrant. Inspired by this sad circumstance, we wanted to investigate parking violations in NYC. In this project, we will first conduct exploratory data analysis in order to better understand the different factors parking violations are associated with, after which we will briefly investigate the potential impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on parking violation counts. We will then construct a map to display the locations at which fire hydrant violations were issued.

### Website Overview
In the exploratory analyses section, you will find:

* Visualization of frequency of violation and violation type

* Violation over day, weekday, and month

* Analyses of fine amount 

* Violation by vehicle types


In the statistical analyses tab, you will find:

* Anova Test - Whether month and weekday are associated with parking violations

* Chi-squared Test - whether the violation types vary among boroughs

* Proportion Test - whether proportions of the population receiving fire hydrant violations in each borough are equal

* COVID-19's Associations with Parking Violations - an investigation into whether COVID-19 case counts are associated with parking violation counts

In Mapping tab, you will find:

* Mapping of hydrant 

* Mapping of hydrant tickets
