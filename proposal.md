## Tentative Project Title

NYC parking violations

## Motivation

As one of our group memberâ€™s car was towed last year because of parking
near by a fire hydrant in Minnesota, we come up with the idea about
doing something related with parking violation.

Our project focuses on the NYC parking violations, we want to
investigate the association between parking violation, time, location
and fine and penalty cost in 2020 and 2021.

## Intended final product

In the end, we want to make a webpage for our project. The website will
include all of our data analysis, statistical models and along with a
final report. We will also make a video to explain the whole process of
our project.

## Anticipated Data Sources

We found two data sets related to our topic from the NYC open data.

-   Open Parking and Camera Violations

<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89>

-   Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2021

<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2021/kvfd-bves>

-   Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2022

<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2022/pvqr-7yc4>

## planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

-   histogram showing number of parking violation from each state in NYC

-   plot showing number of parking and camera violation over the day

-   analyze frequency of each type of violation

-   analyze total fine amount and average fine amount for type of
    violation

-   make a map showing the location of violation and number of violation
    in each county
